EagleEye National Park Application

https://surfinsofia.github.io/EagleEye/



## Description

Users: State Park goers who would like to easily access information about the national parks and daily weather for the national parks. 

What: This application pulls data from the National Parks API and Weather API. This allows users to keep an eye on the current weather conditions at each park.  

Why: By merging both databases we are able to create an application that provides specific and accurate weather and park information.





## Usage
When the user enters the page they are presented with a a display that includes a navagation bar at the top right corner. The navabar contains clickable links that say 'browse parks, webcams as well as a button that says darkmode. 

When the user clicks on browse parks they are taken to the 'begin your quest section' that contains an input dropdown as well as a search button and a check button. When the user clicks the input dropdown they are presented with a list of fifty state codes. Once the user selects a state they then must click the search button, then the check button. The user is then presented with a national park within that state. The user is also presented with the weather for that day as well as park alerts,description and a link that takes them to the parks main website. When the user searches another state they are presented with new information that is appended to the bottom of the page. 

When the user clicks on 'webcams' they are taken to the bottom of the webpage. There the user is presented with live webcams that will refresh every minute of pre-selected nation parks.

when the user clicks on the 'dark mode button' the browser window is adjusted to a darker shade that is easier on the eyes. When the user clicks the button again the shade goes back to normal.

When the user clicks on the 'plan your trip' button they are also taken to the 'begin your quest' section of the page.
